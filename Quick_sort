 - Quicksort

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm with worst case 0(nÂ²) and average case 0(nlgn). It first selects a random element from the input array(pivot element) and seperates the elements lower than the pivot element and the elements that are higher than the pivot element by comparing each element with the pivot element. This gives the position of the pivot element. Now the left and right array are called recursively till only a singe element array remains which is our base case where we return the single element. Its average case can be found by finding the total number of time that comparision takes place and the expected time becomes the sum of the probability of a comparision taking place due to the linearity of expectation. Since a comparision between element i and j takes place only one at a time and the probability of i and j comparision taking place is the probability that i or j are selected as pivot element before any element between i and j are selected we know the probabilty of comparision taking place between i and j.
