Rooted trees
Having multiple children pointers in each node can cause the problem of too much memory waste and will only work if know that no of children is bounded by a certain constant(wont work for arbritary no of childern). So to solve this each node will have two attibut:
1) x.leftmost_child: which points to leftmost child of x
2) x.right_sibling: which points to the sibling just right of x
No children then leftmost_child is Nil and no sibling to right then right_sibling is Nil
