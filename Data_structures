 - Data Structure (or dynamic set)
Dynamic sets are the sets that can be manipulated by algorithms to grow, shrink, or change. Each element can be accessed or modified by using a pointer to that element object. Each element object has a unique key and satellite data that is not used for set implementation. Some of the types of operation that typical data structure support are:
1) Query operation: It does not modify set.Some examples include:
    a) Search(S, k): which takes set S and key K as input and returns the pointer to the element object x such that x.key = k (here we denote x->key as x.key in pseudocode)
    b) Maximum(S): returns the pointer to the object with maximum key value
    c) Minimum(S): returns the pointer to the object with minimum key value
    d) Successor(S, x): returns the pointer to the object that has minimum key value that is higher then x->key
    e) Predeccessor(S, x): returns the pointer to the object that has maximum key value lower then x->key 
2) Modifying operation: It modifies the set itself. Some examples include:
    a) Insert(S, x): Adds element pointed by x
    b) Delete(S, x): Removes element pointed by x 
Examples of data structures include:
1) Heap
2) Stack
3) Queue
4) Linked-list
5) Rooted-tree
6) Hash-table with chaining
7) Hash-table with open addressing
8) Binary-tree
9) Red-and-black-tree
