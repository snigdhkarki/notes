Dynamic programming
It appplies when solving optimization problems(problems that have a lot of solutions (solution consists of set of choices) and where each solution has a certain value associated with it and we want the optimal solution(solution with max or min value value)) and when making a choice it is required to solve a subproblem of same form and the solution to the same subproblem might be required multiple times. It must exibit optimal substructure(optimal solution to a problem uses optimal solution to subproblem). It is different from devide and conquer since it saves the solved subproblems so same subproblems should not be solved more than once.
The two approached to dynamic programming are:
1) TopDown approach: we call the function on smaller and smaller subproblems each time
2) BottomUp approach: we sort all possible subproblems in increasing order and solve each starting from the smallest subproblem
We can reconstruct the solution by not only storing the optimal value but also the optimal choice. 
Shortest path finding algorithm can be sloved using dynamic programming but the longest path problem cant cuz it does not 
satisfy the optimal substructure condition because of the simplicity condition.
