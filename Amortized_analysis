Amortized analysis 
The average cost of an operation in sequence of repeating operations might be less than the worst case cost of that operation
when executed alone. It is different from averagecase analysis because unlike that, it gives the worst case of average time
taken by an operation. The methods of amortized analysis are as follows:
1) Agregate method: In this method we find the total cost of sequence of repeating operation and devide it by no of repeating 
operations.
2) Accounting method: Here we assign a cost higher then the actual cost to the operations that occur at beginnning so that the 
extra credit can be used by operations later on that might have cost more than the cost assigned  to them
3) Potential method: It's like accounting method but instead of having credit from each operation we have credit of the entire 
data structure as potential.

Some of the programs  where this kind of analysis are beneficial are:
1) Multipop
2) Incrementing binary
3) Dynamic table
