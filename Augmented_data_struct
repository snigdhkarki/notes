Augmented data structure 
Its formation process includes:
1) Choose underlying data structure
2) Decide the additional information for each element to have
3) See if you can maintain the additional information in basic modifying operation
4) Add new operations using the additional information
Theorem for making augmented data structure from red black tree: If f is the additional attribute then if f of any element x can be obtained from attributes of x, x.right and x.left then we can maintain the attibute f in insert and delete operation in O(lgn) time
Some of the augmented data structure made by using red black tree include:
1) Order statistic tree
2) Interval tree
